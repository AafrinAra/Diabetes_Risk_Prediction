🔍 Overview  
This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on health attributes such as:

Pregnancies  
Insulin Level  
Age  
BMI  
Glucose  
Blood Pressure  
Diabetes Pedigree Function  
Skin Thickness  

A Machine Learning based web application that predicts the risk of diabetes based on health parameters such as Glucose level, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, etc.  
This project includes EDA, model training, and web deployment using Django.

🎯 Motivation  
Diabetes is one of the fastest-growing health concerns globally. Early detection can prevent long-term health issues and save lives.

The motivation behind this project was:

To build a complete End-to-End ML pipeline  
To explore deployment using Django  
To apply real-world machine learning workflows  
To work on a useful project that can help society
